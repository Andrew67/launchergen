Windows Application Launcher Batch File Generator

Live version: http://launchergen.andrew67.com/

## License
GPL3 (see LICENSE).

## Personal use case
Multi-game PC with specialized controller and USB keypad with number and enter keys, providing an easy way to select a game on system startup.
As the generated launcher is a batch file, it will consume barely any space or CPU resources, and it exits itself when the selected application is started, consuming no resources afterward.

## Target OS
Minimum target OS is Windows XP, so some useful commands introduced in later versions cannot be used.
However, features that definitely require those commands may be added as optional configuration options (with the appropriate requirements listed).
Simple version will not include these features.
